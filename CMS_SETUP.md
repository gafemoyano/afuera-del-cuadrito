# SveltiaCMS Setup for Afuera del Cuadrito

## Overview

This project now includes SveltiaCMS, a modern Git-based headless CMS that serves as a successor to NetlifyCMS/DecapCMS. SveltiaCMS offers better performance, modern UI with dark mode support, mobile compatibility, and many improvements over legacy CMS solutions.

## Setup Complete

‚úÖ Admin interface created at `/public/admin/`
‚úÖ Configuration file configured for your content structure
‚úÖ Collections set up for Posts, Authors, and Pages

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Your Git Backend

Edit `/public/admin/config.yml` and update the backend configuration:

```yaml
backend:
  name: github # or gitlab, gitea
  repo: your-username/afuera-del-cuadrito # Replace with your actual repository
  branch: main # or master
```

### 2. Set up Authentication

You have several options:

**Option A: GitHub/GitLab OAuth (Recommended)**

1. Create an OAuth application in your Git provider
2. Use Netlify's identity service or deploy your own OAuth handler
3. Update the site URLs in the config

**Option B: Personal Access Token (Quick Setup)**

1. Generate a personal access token from your Git provider
2. Use it to sign in directly to the CMS

**Option C: Local Development**

1. For local development, you can use the test backend:

```yaml
backend:
  name: test
```

### 3. Access the CMS

Once configured, access your CMS at:

- Local development: `http://localhost:4321/admin/`
